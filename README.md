# Street Fighter game
I added the following functionality:
- selection of fighters;
- receiving detailed information about the soldier;
- the ability to hit with the A and J keys;
- the ability to hit a superHit once per 10 seconds, using QWE and UIO keys;
- blocking hits using D and L keys;
- Health-bars displaying the state of health of fighters;
- modal window with information about the winner;

## 💡 PS

Fighters don't have animation to move (hit, block), but you will see on Health-bar that functionality works good!

## 🏃‍♂️ Simple start

1. **`npm run setup`** at the root
2. **`npm run dev`** at the root
3. open **`http://localhost:8000/`**

OR

1. **`npm install`** at the root
2. **`npx simple-git-hooks`** at the root
3. **`npm run dev`** at the root
4. open **`http://localhost:8000/`**

## 💡 PS

The project has a [Git Hooks](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) set up, to validate your JS code.

## 🤞 Good luck
